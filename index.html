								<b>Greetings!</b>
								<br> I am Aimi Azizan, a PhD student at <a href="https://guas-astronomy.jp/eng/index.html">SOKENDAI</a>, conducting my research at the <a href="https://www.nao.ac.jp/en/">National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ)</a>. Previously, I completed my master's at the National University of Malaysia (UKM), where I studied the X-ray flares of Sgr A* in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/adlykaannuar/home">UKM Astrophysics</a> research group. My current research focuses on AGNs and galaxy evolution, and I am a member of the <a href="https://pfs.ipmu.jp/l">Prime Focus Spectrograph</a> group at the Subaru Telescope.

								<b> Chandra's 20-Year View of Sagittarius A*'s X-ray Emissions During Flaring and Quiscent Phases (Past Project): </b><br> 
								For my Master's research, I analyzed 20 years of Chandra observations to characterize the quiescent state and flaring events of Sgr A*, examining its X-ray spectral properties such as photon index, column density, and flux over time. 
								<br> 
								The results was presented at the Asia Pacific Physics Conference (APPC15) and were published <a href="https://ifmmy.sharepoint.com/sites/jurnal-fizik-malaysia/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Fjurnal%2Dfizik%2Dmalaysia%2FShared%20Documents%2FJFM%20Published%20Papers%2FVolume%2045%20Issue%201%20%282024%29%2Fjfm2024%5FVol45No1%5F10001%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2Fjurnal%2Dfizik%2Dmalaysia%2FShared%20Documents%2FJFM%20Published%20Papers%2FVolume%2045%20Issue%201%20%282024%29&p=true&ga=1">here</a> and <a href="https://journalarticle.ukm.my/23924/1/SE%2013.pdf">here</a>.

								<b>Detection of Equatorial Plasma Bubbles (EPB) in South East Asia (Past Project): </b><br> 
								For my undergraduate thesis, I worked under the supervision of Dr. Shazana Abdul Hamid and detected the presence of EPB over South East Asia. Specifically, I determined the potential of the Bubble Index from ESA's Swarm satellite by comparing the presence of EPB detected by Swarm and ground-based instruments.  
								<br> 
								The results of this research was presented at Persidangan Fizik Kebangsaan (PERFIK) 2021. The conference abstract can be read <a href="https://utmperfik2021.com/event/3/contributions/102/contribution.pdf">here</a>.

								<i>The final output from the sunspot detection algorithm that displays the sunspot groups.</i>

								<b> Automated Sunspot Number Detection Algorithm (Past Project): </b><br> 
								As a research intern at the astrophysics laboratory at Pusat GENIUS@Pintar Negara, I worked on developing a algorithm that can detect and measure the sunspot number automatically using image recognition. 
								The algorithm was tested on several solar images taken from Pusat GENIUS@Pintar Negara, UKM, using a 480mm focal length apochromatic refractor telescope. This study compared the sunspot number obtained from the algorithm with the sunspot number measured manually and with data taken from SILSO.
								<br> 
								The results of this research was presented at the Southeast Asia Regional Astronomy Seminar (SARAS) 2021 and the paper can be reached <a href="https://www.academia.edu/79447512/AUTOMATED_SUNSPOT_NUMBER_DETECTION_ALGORITHM_A_PRELIMINARY_STUDY">here</a>.
